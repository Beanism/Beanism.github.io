			<h1 class="About-Us-Text">About Us</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Beanism is a UK based religion in which we believe all is descended from beans. Simply put it, we believe of the Beanterror (Hallowed be thy beany name), who is the Mother Bean, the creator of all.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">We believe the Beanterror (Hallowed be thy beany name) lives in what we believe to be called The Great Flying Pod In The Sky, in which is a infinitely large yet infinitely small flying bean pod in the sky.
			<p class="About-Us-Text">The Great Flying Pod In The Sky is where all dead bean souls go to rest. Once a bean dies, they are transported up into the Great Flying Pod In The Sky, and are to live there for 100 years, until they shall be reborn as a bean of their choice.</p>
			<h1 class="About-Us-Text"> Our Creation Story</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text"> In the beginning, there where two beans. Beany, and Beano. They loved each like brothers, and would do each task, no matter how large, or how small, together. Always. However, Beano grew board. Beano felt simply being a bean was not enough. Beano wanted more. So, Beano, using his beanly powers, tried to create a new world, a new bean. And he created the Earth.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Beano grew excited. Had he finally created something that was not a bean? He had. Using his unfathomable power, he had created an object not of beanly substance. But this power, this ability to create such warped, unbeanlike objects, corrupted Beano. Dark thoughts raced through his head. <i>Why does Beany even exist? I don't need him anymore.</i> And so, he attacked Beany, thus beginning the Great Bean War.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Beany was confused when Beano attacked him. He didn't understand. But, once he saw the object not of flesh of bean Beano had created, he understood. Beano had to die. Beany summoned Baked Bean after Baked Bean, but could not touch Beano. So, using his beanlike power, banished Beano for all eternety to no bean's land. But the damage had alreay been done.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Beano had created the universe. A universe of no bean. It was horrifying to Beany. <i>How could Beano do this? I thought we were brothers.</i> Beany searched for millenia, however could not find a single bean. And so on the last planet he searched, he cried. And cried. And then, it happened. The planet sprung into life. So many beans. Big beans, small beans, baked beans, human beans, and many more. Beany rejoiced. There where still beans. And so, he to protect his colony, he took up a new name.
			<p class="About-Us-Text"> The Beanterror (Hallowed be thy beany name). To show his terrifying power. However, after a century, he realised. The beans are dying. And they did not grow, or spring back. They simply wilted, and died. And so, using his beany power, created a pod, in the sky. He made it so all bean souls on death return to the pod, and after 100 years, return to the mortal world as a bean of their choice. And then, he watched. Simply watched. He watched his beans grow, and evolve, and he is still there, now, and he will be there for eternity. Watching.</p>
