			<h1 class="About-Us-Text">Who are we?</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">We are Beans, devout followers of the Church of Beanism. Here, we beleve all are connected by the fact that we are all beans. Here, we are all equal.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">We accept anyone and everyone into our Church, no matter if they are a Kidney Bean, Baked Bean, or any other kind.</p>
			<h1 class="About-Us-Text">Where are we?</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">As of current, our teachings are lightly spread. Hence, unfortunately, we have followers few, and close between.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">It is of this reason that we have the majority of our followers gathered in Malton, UK.</p>
			<h1 class="About-Us-Text">Why are we?</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">'Why?' Indeed. Simply, the reason for us Beans to suddenly announce our faith is simple. We felt as if the people where forgetting our memorable faith.</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Our faith we believe is the true faith, and here at Beanism we believed that many where forgetting our beliefs. So, we have announced our faith for the world to hear, and to remember.</p>
			<h1 class="About-Us-Text">How can I join?</h1>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">Here at the Church of Beanism, we do not believe in 'joining', for you are already an unofficial part of our community!</p>
			<p class="About-Us-Text">However, if you feel you must announce your faith for the world to hear, please email us! You can find our Church's email in the 'Contact Us' page.</p>
